## Code overview

### init_wallet
Initalize a PDA with seed "white-list" to hold whiteList,owner and feeWallet. 

### add_to_whitelist
Add a public key to the whitelist. Only the authorized wallet can append to the whitelist. Ensures addresses in the list are unique.

Update the fee wallet. Only the authorized owner can update it.

### remove_from_whitelist

Remove an address from the list. Only the authorized owner can call this function

### approve_delegate

Approve token from the user to delegate, which is our PDA. Later, we can spend the token on behalf of the user in the `process_purchase` function.

### process_prchase

Process the purchase, deduct the approved token from the buyer's wallet address, and transfer it to the fee wallet and merchant account. Only public keys in the whitelist can execute this operation.
